Azure OpenAI Multi-Tool Agent Documentation

This is a sample document for testing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

The Azure OpenAI Multi-Tool Agent is an intelligent assistant that can:
1. Generate professional emails based on user prompts
2. Summarize text content clearly and concisely
3. Answer questions from uploaded documents using vector search

The system uses FAISS for vector storage and Azure OpenAI for embeddings and chat completions.
The architecture includes FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend user interface.

Key Technologies:
- Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini for chat, text-embedding-3-small for embeddings)
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- FastAPI for REST API
- Streamlit for web UI
- Python 3.12

This agent demonstrates the power of combining multiple AI tools into a single intelligent system.
